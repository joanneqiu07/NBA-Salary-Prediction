# nba-salary-prediction
Final project for PIC 16A Winter 2022

# Group Members: 
Joanne Qiu, Yupei Hu, Shikang Yang 

# Project Description
The project is about to use past stats, such as scores, player efficiency rate, shooting percentage, for NBA
players to predict their salary for the future season by applying multiple regression. The inputs will be the
basic stats for the player and the outputs will be a numerical value of salary prediction.

The cleaner.py includes the custom class for data cleaning. The model.jpynb is the demo file.

# Package requirements
We used packages learned in class, such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. We also included other packages, such as Plotly, seaborn, and statsmodels

Use `conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt` to install the package requirements

Download the cleaner.py(https://github.com/joanneqiu07/nba-salary-prediction/blob/17edc0795688a11540bf06f4086837f2cbc81d47/cleaner.py)

# Detailed description

There are ten steps in our project. The demo file has included detailed comment for users to follow the progress.

1. Features Engineering

Import two datasets and clean the data with the Cleaner class. 
Steps include cleaning the salary column, merging two datasets together, and changing columns' names.

2. Distribution Graph

Use Plotly to create an interactive plot for users to check the stats for each player and see the relation between points and salary (Points vs. Salary)

Create histograms to see the distributions of different variables

3. Basic Statistcs

Check for multilinearity

separate the data into label and train set.

4. Train, Test Spliting

Split the training set and the testing set.

5. Defining metrics

Define a function called `regress_results()` to calculate different scores of the models.

6. Linear Regression

Build a linear regression model and fit it to the training set.
Test the regression model.
Fit a linear model using the Ordinary Least Squares.

7. Principle Component Analysis

Since there are some features that have multi-colinearity, we can use PCA to reduce the dimensions of our input. Reformat and view results, reduce the features to two.

8. AdaBoost

Build an AdaBoost Regression model and check its performance.

9. RandomForest

Build a random forest model and check its performance.

10. Cross Validation

Use cross validation to improve the models.

# Scope and limitations
The limitation of this program is that the features need to be modified according to different Datasets. You can modify the parameters according to your purpose. More features can be extended to make different predictions.
